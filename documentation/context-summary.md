Part 1 Core:

Built a startup menu with three tasks:
1️⃣ Report Issues (implemented)
2️⃣ Local Events & Announcements (disabled in Part 1)
3️⃣ Service Request Status (to be added later).

Report Issue captured:

Category, Location, Description, Attachment.

Data stored in a basic collection (List<Issue>).

Implemented a citizen engagement counter after submission.

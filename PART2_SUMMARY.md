# Part 2 Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Advanced Data Structures Implementation

All required data structures have been implemented in `Services/EventService.cs`:

#### SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<EventItem>>
- **Purpose**: Maintain events in chronological order for efficient date-based queries
- **Usage**: Primary storage for events sorted by date
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for insertion, O(n) for range queries
- **Endpoint**: `/api/Events/service/all`

#### Stack<EventItem>
- **Purpose**: Track recently viewed events (Last-In-First-Out)
- **Usage**: When users view an event, it's pushed onto the stack
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for push/pop operations
- **Endpoint**: `/api/Events/recently-viewed?count=5`

#### Queue<EventItem>
- **Purpose**: Manage upcoming events (First-In-First-Out)
- **Usage**: Future events are enqueued for sequential processing
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for enqueue/dequeue
- **Endpoint**: `/api/Events/upcoming?count=10`

#### HashSet<EventCategory>
- **Purpose**: Maintain unique event categories for O(1) filtering
- **Usage**: Fast category validation and filtering
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for contains operations
- **Endpoint**: `/api/Events/categories`

#### Dictionary<string, int>
- **Purpose**: Track search query frequencies for recommendation engine
- **Usage**: Analyzes user search patterns to suggest relevant events
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for get/set operations
- **Endpoints**: `/api/Events/track-search` (POST), `/api/Events/recommendations?count=5`

### 2. Event Management Features

‚úÖ **16 Sample Events Seeded**
- Diverse categories: Community, Health, Education, Government, Recreation, etc.
- Realistic dates spanning the next 45 days
- Complete event details including location, capacity, registration requirements

‚úÖ **Search & Filter System**
- Real-time search by keyword (title, description, location)
- Category filtering using HashSet for O(1) lookups
- Date range filtering using SortedDictionary
- Combined filters support (search + category + date)

‚úÖ **Sort Functionality**
- Sort by date (ascending/descending)
- Sort by title (A-Z, Z-A)
- Sort by category
- Frontend caching and useMemo optimization

‚úÖ **Recommendation Engine**
- Tracks user search queries in Dictionary<string, int>
- Analyzes search frequency to identify patterns
- Suggests events based on search history
- Displays "You May Also Like" section

‚úÖ **Event Creation**
- Full CRUD operations for events
- Category selection with enum validation
- Media upload support
- Automatic addition to all data structures
- Events publish immediately

‚úÖ **Issue Reporting**
- Complete issue submission workflow
- Category-based classification
- Media upload support
- Reference number generation
- Status tracking

### 3. Frontend Implementation

‚úÖ **Navigation Bar**
- Responsive design with mobile menu
- Active page highlighting
- Accessible across all pages
- Clean, modern UI with shadcn/ui components

‚úÖ **Events Page**
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Category dropdown with all 9 categories
- Sort options for date and title
- Event cards with full details
- Recommendation section
- Recently viewed section
- Responsive grid layout

‚úÖ **Create Event Page**
- Comprehensive form with validation
- Category selection
- Date/time pickers
- Registration toggle
- Contact information fields
- Media upload
- Success feedback

‚úÖ **Report Issue Page**
- Issue submission form
- Category selection (7 categories)
- Location input
- Media upload
- Success message with reference number

### 4. Technical Improvements

‚úÖ **JSON Enum Serialization**
- Enums serialize as strings instead of numbers
- Better API readability and debugging
- Consistent category naming across backend/frontend

‚úÖ **Category Handling**
- Backend enum: `Community`, `Public_Safety`, `Health`, etc.
- Frontend display: "Community", "Public Safety", "Health", etc.
- Automatic underscore replacement for display
- Proper enum mapping in both directions

‚úÖ **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
- Validation feedback

‚úÖ **Performance Optimization**
- useMemo for filtered results
- Query caching in API client
- Efficient data structure operations
- Minimal re-renders

## üìä Data Structure Usage Examples

### Creating an Event
```csharp
// Automatically adds to:
// - SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<EventItem>>
// - Dictionary<Guid, EventItem> for O(1) lookups
// - HashSet<EventCategory> for unique categories
// - Queue<EventItem> if it's a future event
_eventService.AddEvent(newEvent);
```

### Searching Events
```csharp
// Uses HashSet for O(1) category validation
// Uses SortedDictionary for efficient date filtering
var results = _eventService.SearchEvents(
    query: "community",
    category: "Health",
    startDate: DateTime.Today,
    endDate: DateTime.Today.AddMonths(1)
);
```

### Viewing an Event
```csharp
// Adds to Stack<EventItem> for recently viewed tracking
var event = _eventService.GetEventById(id);
// Event is now on top of the recently viewed stack
```

### Getting Recommendations
```csharp
// Analyzes Dictionary<string, int> search frequency
// Returns events matching top search patterns
var recommendations = _eventService.GetRecommendations(count: 5);
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing instructions and troubleshooting steps.

## üìù Notes

- Events are stored both in SQLite database and in-memory data structures
- In-memory data structures provide faster access for recommendations and recent views
- Category enum ensures type safety and prevents invalid categories
- All endpoints are documented in Swagger at http://localhost:5120/swagger
